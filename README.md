# Cibersecurity_Siem_Elasticstack
Develop and implement a security monitoring system (SIEM) using open source tools, such as Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or OpenDistro for Elasticsearch (a variant of Elastic Stack that is completely free). This will allow the collection, analysis, and visualization of logs to detect threats and generate alerts.
